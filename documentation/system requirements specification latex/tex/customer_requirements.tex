For this project, a table will be constructed upon which the top surface will consist of a video display.
The display will recognize specific objects played on top of it and will be able to track their
movement across the surface if moved or rotated. Object recognition will be dependent on
uniquely shaped or patterned markers placed on the bottom of the object. For objects placed on
the surface of the table that do not contain a recognized pattern (like a fingertip), the table will
treat as user interaction (touch gesture).

\subsection{The product will be a table of three feet by three feet in any geometric shape that is feasible}
\subsubsection{Description}
While geometric shape isn't important, the table should be tall enough for items to be placed on it without being obscured.

\subsubsection{Constraints}
The projector must be able to project evenly onto the surface and have a focal length that allows the display to remain in focus. The resulting structure should be stable enough to support several aluminum cylinders in the worst case.

\subsection{The product will recognize user touch interaction}
\subsubsection{Description}
Utilizing a projector and sensor, the table will recognize all input that is not a fiducial markers as touch input.

\subsubsection{Constraints}
High precision may not be possible due to sensor limits and input lag.

\subsection{The product will recognize fiducial markers}
\subsubsection{Description}
Utilizing the a fiducial recognition library, the table will recognize the fidcuial markers of multiple different career cylinders or pucks to display career information.

\subsection{The product will display career information}
\subsubsection{Description}
The product will maintain a database of career information, which will trigger a view operation upon placement of a marker.

\subsubsection{Constraints}
The storage capacity of the device will determine the limit to the number of entries.

\subsection{The product will allow modification of the career information}
\subsubsection{Description}
A content management system will be created to update career entries, delete them, and add new ones.

\subsubsection{Constraints}
The User Interface may be difficult to type with, so a keyboard may be necessary for input. This content management system may consist of directly querying the database if time constraints become a factor.

\subsection{The product will utilize a dial interface}
\subsubsection{Description}
The final product will allow rotation of the fiducial markers to affect user interaction in a meaningful way. For example, to access different froms of media within a particular career.

\subsubsection{Constraints}
The detection hardware might make this particular implementation difficult. This will need to be allowed by the Reactivision Library, or the Fiducial Library in use.
