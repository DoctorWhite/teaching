\subsection{The system shall run smoothly during usage }
\subsubsection{Description}
The system will respond as soon as the user makes the command or motion on the touch screen. The user interface should change accordingly with what the user wants.
\subsubsection{Source}
Development Team
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The hardware will constrain the actual response of the user interface. Software bugs could also affect the speed and responsiveness of the interface.

\subsection{The projector will display the correct career profile for viewing based on fiducial marker selected }
\subsubsection{Description}
The projector will display a career profile that the user selects through fiducial markers.
\subsubsection{Source}
Development Team
\subsubsection{Constraints}
Career profiles will only be available for a select few. Not every career in the Air Force will be stored into this system.

\subsection{The sensor shall record and process user input in real time }
\subsubsection{Description}
The sensor will record all user movement and interactions with the table and display various information selected by user.
\subsubsection{Source}
Development Team
\subsubsection{Constraints}
This is limited by the speed of the sensor. May also be affected if something blocks the inputs from being read.

\subsection{The supporting table structure shall support weight placed on to the structure }
\subsubsection{Description}
The table will be able to support enough weight and hold form when more than just the fiducial markers are placed on to the surface. 
\subsubsection{Source}
Development Team
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The table will only support as much as the materials that make up the table can support. Exceeding the limit of the materials will cause cracking and harm to the supporting structure.
